# GazeHelper

GazeHelper is an eye-tracking research tool intended to study the potential relief of symptoms of amblyopia (lazy eye), strabismus (crossed eyes), and ADHD using gaze-responsive exercise methods. Research subjects are able to watch video within the application which, when used with a supported eye-tracking device, will blur the image proportionally to the degree of divergence when symptoms are detected. Then, as it's natural for the brain to want to see a clear image, the eyes will respond accordingly by correcting their gaze. This allows subjects to gradually train their gaze alignment and maintain focus. Over time, initial research has shown these sorts of exercises can have positive long-term results.

GazeHelper is provided as an [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) desktop app that supports the [SR Research EyeLink](https://www.sr-research.com/) eye-tracker.
