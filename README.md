# Gazefix

Gazefix is a visually-responsive eye-tracking research application intended as a tool to relive symptoms of amblyopia (lazy eye), strabismus (crossed eyes), and even ADHD.

Developed by Ryan Dern (<rdern@pm.me>) and Professor Marc Pomplun in the [Visual Attention Laboratory](https://www.cs.umb.edu/~marc/lab/gallery.html) at the University of Massachusetts Boston.
