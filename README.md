# GazeHelper

GazeHelper is an eye-tracking research tool intended to study the potential relief of symptoms of amblyopia (lazy eye), strabismus (crossed eyes), and ADHD using gaze-responsive exercise methods. Research subjects are able to watch video within the application which, when used with a supported eye-tracking device, will blur the image when their symptoms are detected. This allows subjects to gradually train their natural gaze alignment and maintain focus.

GazeHelper is provided as an [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) desktop app that supports the [SR Research EyeLink](https://www.sr-research.com/) eye-tracker. 

Developed by [Ryan Dern](https://github.com/RMDern) under the guidance of Professor Marc Pomplun in the [Visual Attention Laboratory](https://www.cs.umb.edu/~marc/lab/gallery.html) at the University of Massachusetts Boston.
